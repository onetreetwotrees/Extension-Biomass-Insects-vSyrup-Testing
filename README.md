# Extension-Biomass-Insects-vSyrup-Testing
Jane's version called "Syrup Testing" of Biomass Insects. Needs to be reconciled with other's edits.

This is Jane's working code for Biomass Insects that has been compatible with Landis-II v6.0 and other extensions.
Latest update of Landis-II requires additional modification to be compatible with Core and other extensions.
